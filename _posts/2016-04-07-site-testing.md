Decided to try and simplify my blog a bit. I was running a Jekyll/bootstrap thing
that someone else had thrown together, but I was never terribly happy with it, so I
decided to start over with a blank Jekyll install and just mix in the Bootstrap
parts that I actually want.

Took a little bit of time to tweak the templates, but I'm pretty happy with the
outcome, particularly the labels for categories and tags on the posts.
